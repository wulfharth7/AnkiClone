Assignment to be done by the end of the spring semestre. First time using databases and windows form, will be updating it over and over with time.

Trying to practice the database knowledge that I've got to learn in C#, I'm pretty a beginner at C#, and there are new concepts like OOP, but I am trying my best to 
apply them the best way I can, with good programming practices.

So far I can create a database, update it, insert data into it, and select from it. All done in MS Access DB. There is a login page that works pretty well, but only
for one user for now. I'll update it to become multi-usered soon. From the app it can be logged out.

My plan is to make Decks unique to the users. Today I've finished the login page, logging out was buggy, not anymore. We'll see what will happen later. I'll keep updating
here.
